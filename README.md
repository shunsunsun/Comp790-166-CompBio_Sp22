# Comp790-166: Computational Biology (Spring 2022) 

## Details
Instructor: Natalie Stanley

Email: natalies@cs.unc.edu

Time and Place: Monday/Wednesday 9:30am-10:45am in SN0115

Office Hours: Monday 10:45-noon or by appointment 

## Description
Modern, high-throughput assays allow us to efficiently profile a variety of biological processes to gain a systems-level understanding of health and disease. Recent technologies and experimental assays generate an abundance of detailed information that needs to be extracted, summarized, and interpreted. In this course we will discuss the methodology used to extract signal from (e.g. process, engineer features from, combine, etc.) data generated by some of the most cutting-edge experimental paradigms, such as single-cell assays and imaging. We will go into detail about the methods and theory underlying bioinformatics algorithms, originating from numerical linear algebra, graph-signal processing, and machine learning. While computational biology is a very broad field, we will focus here on applications in single-cell biology (CyTOF, single-cell RNA sequencing), multiomics/multi-modal analysis, systems immunology, and benchmarking. For each class of algorithms introduced for some task on biological data, we will also go over necessary theory and mathematical intuition. The course covers the foundations for biomedical data science and does not assume any biological knowledge.

## Prerequistes
Students should be strong in programming in Python or Julia or R, and be comfortable with linear algebra and basic probability. **I do not assume any prior biological knowledge. Any relevant concepts will be introduced**. Please feel free to talk to me about any of these prerequistes. 

## Course Structure
This course will be mostly lecture-based with two homework assignments and a course project. I will provide ideas for several publicly available biological datasets and open problems for you to work on for these projects. Overall, the project is intended to give you an opportunity to implement/apply methodology discussed in the papers that we will discuss together. The final project writeup will also give you practice writing up results and communicating ideas. You are welcome to work on teams for this project.

Students will also pick any two days during the semester to answer a set of reading questions about one of the assigned papers.

# Homework, Project, Reading, Grading, Etc

## Homework
There will be two homework assignments to practice implementing particular concepts. Often, things can become a bit easier to understand and use when they are implemented by you. I will provide code and hints in Python, but will be happy to read/run code written in Python, R, Julia, or Matlab. Please submit your homework writeup as a PDF. 

## Background Resources
Most of what we discuss in class will come from papers. However, I suggest the following textbooks as background references. Conveniently, they are also available for free.

* [PRML] Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning-- Chris Bishop [[Link](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)]

* [SLMP] Spectral Learning on Matrices and Tensors -- Majid Janzamin et al. [[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07984)]

* The Matrix Cookbook [[Link](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf)]

* [PML] Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction. -- Kevin Murphy [[Link](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html)]

## Readings
Each student much choose two class meetings to answer reading questions for one of the discussed papers. Please answer the following questions and send the responses in PDF format to me by the beginning of our class meeting. 

### Reading Questions

**Please choose one paper per week on the weeks when reading summaries are due and turn them in before our class meeting 9:30 am to natalies+comp790@cs.unc.edu**. 

1) Please explain in 2 sentences or less what the problem being solved is.

2) What were the main contributions of the authors in this work? (You can answer in a few bullet points). 

3) Please describe 1-2 computational experiments that the authors implemented to test their method.

4) Were the authors the first to attempt this particular problem? If not, did they compare their results to other baselines? Do you think that their evaluation was objective?

5) Do you think that the authors provided enough evidence for why their developed method is an important contribution? If yes, please describe their reasoning here. If you do not think they adequately justified why they worked on this particular problem, please describe your thoughts on that here. 

6) What is one follow-up idea or extension from this work? 

## Final Project
I will provide you with several examples of publicly available biological datasets and problems (https://github.com/stanleyn/Comp790-166-Comp-Bio/blob/main/Datasets.md -- updated link coming soon!). Half-way through the semester, you will submit your project proposal and present your idea to the class.  The proposal will be a short document describing 1) The problem 2) A background on other people's attempts to solve this problem and 3) A background on your idea of a solution and 4) the data you will use to test your method. At the end of the semester you will write a short paper explaining your method and results and present your results.

## Grading
 Grading will be based on the following

1) Reading Questions : 20% over the entire semester
2) Homework 1: 20%
3) Homework 2: 20%
4) Project Proposal : 10%
5) Project final writeup: 30%
